# arduinoRobot
Date: 5-Mar-2016

So this is my first project after entering college. Basically this is an arduino controlled robot. 
Arduino, 2-motor driver shields (H - Bridge L293D), 4 motors and a  Bluetooth module (HC-05) was used. 
The main C code recieves data from bluetooth and does appropriate actions, like running motors in forward or backward directions.
